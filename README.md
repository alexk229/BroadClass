# BroadClass

A gap currently exists between how well students and teachers can communicate within the classroom and outside of it. Current solutions offer students the ability to ask questions to students and teachers, but there are still problems with forming connections, creating natural conversations, and communicating complex ideas. We realize that forming connections outside of class time for studying and group work can be a challenge, so we want to meet that need by making student collaboration easy. Additionally, we intend for our project to bridge the gap between students, their peers, and their professors by providing students the power to form natural conversations with others quickly and intuitively. On top of that, we understand that communicating complex ideas with just words can hamstring the process of understanding a question. We intend to make sharing words, images, and videos between students and teachers simple. Our project aims to find a solution to all of these problems so that students can find answers to their questions and share ideas with ease.
Currently there are few option for a group messaging service for a classroom sized group. Services like Piazza are used to give a classroom a private forum to ask questions, and services such as Canvas provide a place for professors to post new assignments or class announcements. The issues with forums is often lack of specific group collaboration or individual communication, and services like Canvas do not offer a desirable form of student-to-student or student-to-professor communication. Neither of these services provide adaptable forms of chat-like communication which can be extended to multiple users or share images, sounds, and videos. Other instant messaging services, such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, provide real-time chatting with media and multiple users, but do not offer a classroom environment where students and professors can be distinguished or where users can be divided into groups.
The solution we are seeking to implement is an instant messenger designed around the concept of, and for use in, a classroom environment. A text message style group messaging system has not seen wide use for a classroom environment, and this type of service offers large benefits to an environment already full of savvy mobile device users by capitalizing on the familiarity and convenience of text messaging. This would allow for easier access to a more fluid conversation system, and overall would be desired for strengthening a classroom environment. Using Android devices and Web servers, a professor-organized group messaging service can be created to allow for a simple but flexible messaging environment that is easily managed and accessible.
